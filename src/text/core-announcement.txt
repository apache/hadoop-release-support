This release does not include the bundle.jar containing the AWS SDK, used by the s3a connector
in the hadoop-aws module.
To use it, download from Maven Central the version of the SDK you wish to use:

https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/software.amazon.awssdk/bundle/versions

For this release, the version to download is ${aws.sdk2.version}
https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/software/amazon/awssdk/bundle/${aws.sdk2.version}/)

1. Download the bundle-${aws.sdk2.version}.jar artifact and check its signature with
   the accompanying bundle-${aws.sdk2.version}.jar.asc file.

2. Copy the JAR to share/hadoop/common/lib/

(Newer AWS SDK versions should work, though regressions are almost inevitable)
