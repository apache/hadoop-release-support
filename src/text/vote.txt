[VOTE] Release Apache Hadoop ${hadoop.version}

Apache Hadoop ${hadoop.version}

I have put together a release candidate (${rc}) for Hadoop ${hadoop.version}.

What we would like is for anyone who can to verify the tarballs, especially
anyone who can try the arm64 binaries as we want to include them too.

The RC is available at:
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/hadoop/${rc.dirname}/

The git tag is ${tag.name}, commit ${git.commit.id}

The maven artifacts are staged at
${asf.staging.url}

You can find my public key at:
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/hadoop/common/KEYS

Change log

Release notes

This is off branch-3.4.1

Key changes include

* Bulk Delete API. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-18679
* Fixes and enhancements in Vectored IO API.
* Improvements in Hadoop Azure connector.
* Fixes and improvements post upgrade to AWS V2 SDK in S3AConnector.
* This release includes Arm64 binaries. Please can anyone with
  compatible systems validate these.

Note, because the arm64 binaries are built separately on a different
platform and JVM, their jar files may not match those of the x86
release -and therefore the maven artifacts. I don't think this is
an issue (the ASF actually releases source tarballs, the binaries are
there for help only, though with the maven repo that's a bit blurred).

The only way to be consistent would actually untar the x86.tar.gz,
overwrite its binaries with the arm stuff, retar, sign and push out
for the vote. Even automating that would be risky.

Please try the release and vote. The vote will run for 5 days.
