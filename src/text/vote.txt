[VOTE] Release Apache Hadoop ${hadoop.version}

Apache Hadoop ${hadoop.version}

I have put together a release candidate (${rc}) for Hadoop ${hadoop.version}.

What we would like is for anyone who can to verify the tarballs, especially
anyone who can try the arm64 binaries as we want to include them too.

The RC is available at:
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/hadoop/${rc.dirname}/

The git tag is ${tag.name}, commit ${git.commit.id}

The maven artifacts are staged at
${asf.staging.url}

You can find my public key at:
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/hadoop/common/KEYS

Change log
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/hadoop/${rc.dirname}/CHANGELOG.md

Release notes
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/hadoop/${rc.dirname}/RELEASENOTES.md

Build note: the maven artifacts are off the aarch64 release, not the x86;
single builds on ec2 VMs through our cloud infra kept resulting in multiple staging repos,
probably a side effect of our VPN setup.

A raspberry pi5 is perfectly adequate to cut a release, even with just an SD Card as the storage.
I built the x86 release remotely, though as I have an 2016 ubuntu laptop I could try there too.


AWS SDK
-------

Previous releases included a "lean" tar without the AWS SDK, and/or encountered
problems with the size of the .tar artifacts.

Now all releases are built without the AWS SDK; it must be explicitly added to
share/hadoop/common/lib/

To add aws support to hadoop, download from Maven Central the version of the SDK
you wish to use:

https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/software.amazon.awssdk/bundle/versions

For this release, the version to download is ${aws.sdk2.version}
https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/software/amazon/awssdk/bundle/${aws.sdk2.version}/)

1. Download the bundle-${aws.sdk2.version}.jar artifact and check its signature with
   the accompanying bundle-${aws.sdk2.version}.jar.asc file.

2. Copy the JAR to share/hadoop/common/lib/

Newer AWS SDK versions _should_ work, though regressions are almost inevitable.

Please try the release and vote. The vote will run for 5 days.
